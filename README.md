# Canvas-Game-Template

This Repository is the template for other games I am making in computer science 10 this year (2022/2023). This repository is a basic, no texture version of a game where the border shoots red bullets at the green main character.
Use the arrow keys of WASD top move, p to pause, and r to restart. Optimizations and comments will be added as time goes on.
